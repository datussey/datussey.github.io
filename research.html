												<h2>Research Interests</h2>
												<section id="int1">
												<h3>Sterile Insect Technique of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												My current research focuses on improving the quality of sterilized Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for use in sterile insect technique (SIT). 
												Specifically, I’m working to make sterilized males more competitive against wild males for access to females in the wild through 
												reducing non-target effects that reduce the performance of males that arise during mass rearing and sterilization through gamma-irradiation. 
												From egg collection through release, there are numerous inefficiencies that can lead to poor quality sterile males. 
												If SIT is a business, then sterile males are the product, and my goals are to make that product more reliable and cost effective.

												<section id="int2">
												<h3>Invasive Species and Climate Change </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												As temperate areas continue to warm, the risk of invasive species establishment also rises. In addition, the ranges of invasive
												species already in the United States will continue to broaden as climates continue to warm. Areas that once had prohibitively cold 
												winters are becoming more suitable for novel pests. I’m interested in determining which species will pose the greatest hazards as 
												climates continue to warm. Climate change may also allow for novel biological control agents to be introduced into systems that were
												once unsuitable for them. By understanding how both pest and beneficial species respond physiologically and ecologically to climate 
												change, we can more accurately predict risks and begin to find solutions.

												<section id="int3">
												<h3>Sustainable Agriculture </h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The potential tool-kit for growers to protect crops from pest insects is continually expanding. In addition to novel synthetic 
												insecticides that have reduced non-target effects, there are cultural and mechanical methods of pest control that are becoming 
												more feasible as technology advances. From the use of drone technology to identify areas of increased pest presence, to the use of
												AI to target individual plants infested within a field, there are many ways to control pests in a more sustainable and cost-effective way.
